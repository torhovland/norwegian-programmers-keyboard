# Norwegian Programmer's Keyboard
A keyboard layout suited for programmers writing code as well as Norwegian and English prose.

## Features
- Braces are readily available without requiring Alt Gr.
- No symbols using Alt Gr require two fingers on the right hand.
- Z, X, C, V are unchanged to preserve important keyboard shortcuts.
- H, J, K, L are still convenient to use for navigation in Vim.
- Most of the symbols on the number row are left as on a standard Norwegian keyboard.
- Backspace and Caps Lock are swapped.
- Otherwise optimized using [Carpalx](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/), with code as well as Norwegian and English prose used as input.
